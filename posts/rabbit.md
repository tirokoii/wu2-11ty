title: Rabbit

Today I read a book for the first time in forever, a real physical book, 
made of paper! Crazy right? Who would have thought it could be semi fun to read,
not me! It's about this cursed rabbit lamp that eats a kids brain in his mind and
destroys an corrupt company by eating their important documents at night.
Apparently this rabbit is really cute and pretty, with all white fur shining like the sun,
black eyes, tail and ears with a finishing touch of black at the tips and super pink little nose.
Well-well, anyway here's an image of my cat.
