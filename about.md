<h2>Hello, im ME!</h2>

<p>I have been given this project as an training task for a webb developing course
im taking at the NTI gymnasium. In this project we are supposed to learn how to make
static websites, that are easier to use for us developing them. We are apparently
doing this with an add-on called eleventy or 11ty for short, we are also using nunjucks.
Somehow it is working, nunjucks are there to make it easier to use ECMA-script(js) functions in html and md files all the wing-parantes {} are connected to nunjucks, there are multiple extentions like nunjucks, but our teacher preached of its incredible simplicity. Anyway 11ty is used to build the website, to bring everything together, it makes using md or nunjuck files possible to write pages easily, without having to redo the style and html layout.
